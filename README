RUNNING:
-------------------
In this directory you will find the file 'cppmatrix',
which is a x86_64 bit compiled binary. It requires ncurses to run.

usage:

   cppmatrix [-s speed] [-c color]

where 'speed' is an approximate FPS cppmatrix tries to run at (defaults to 20),
and 'color' is a string of the color to display the text in (defaults to green)
supported colors are:

    green, blue, red, yello, magenta/purple, cyan, white, and black

example usage:

    cppmatrix -s 40 -c blue


COMPILING:
-------------------
You will need g++ and make to compile (technically make is optional - it's not
that hard to compile by hand!)
For other systems, you will need to install the ncurses development libraries,
installed with:

    sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev

for debian/ubuntu systems; modify for your package manager.
Make sure you

    sudo ldconfig

to update your libraries!
Then type:

    make clean
    make

which should give you a usable in this directory. You can then place the
program somwhere like /usr/local/bin so you can run cppmatrix wherever!
